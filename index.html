            Over the years I have found lots of new hobbies with the most recent
            one being coding and learning lots of different coding languages. My
            biggest hobby would have to be football and supporting Newcastle

            them has been something I’ve enjoyed doing. Some of the other
            hobbies I have is: F1, gym, cooking and martial arts.

        <p class="projects-text">
          Over the last year i have been learning to code within my free time by
          teaching myself or taking courses from udemy. I am currently going
          through all the courses and updating the styling to match this
          webiste. The courses i have taken involve Node.js, PHP, React, CSS and
          JS.
          <br /><br />
          To go long with building the projects i have built this webiste and
          the css template currently being used on here and server landing page
          ive built as well. I decided to build the css template as a way of
          learning more about css and it would be great training for me.
